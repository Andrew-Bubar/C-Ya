# C-Ya
A simple C game engine

A small hobby project I desided to start. The main project (for now) will just be me but anyone may pick it up to use. 
I also have it under the MIT license so you may do with it as you wish. 
The primary goal is to give a nice C frame-work for people new to the language. 
As well as for those who just want to wip up an application quickly.

I used gcc as my compialer, and vsCode as my IDE (as I'm sure is obvious).

CURRENT BUGS:

1. SetGameName currently doesn't work sadly. Though I put progress of that on the back burner as I work on rendering as of writting.
